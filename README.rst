Overview
========

``ftw.blog`` provides a blog implementation for Plone featuring tags and
categories.

A user can add a new blog entry and tag it using tags and categories.
Available categories are defined by the creator of the blog, whilst
tags can be added freely by the author of a blog entry.

Blog entries are listed in chronological order, in a tag cloud, by 
categories, and in a monthly archive. Entries can be searched by using the
search function of the blog.

Optionally, blog entries can be commented by users using Plone's commenting
functionality.
